									<h2>Is Phone Key Secure?</h2>
									<p> Compromising Keyless Entry for Tesla Model 3</p>

								<p>
									<b> Exploit: </b> Authentication Bypass by Spoofing <br/>
									<b> Data: </b> 2022-03-06 <br/>
									<b> Exploit Authors: </b> Kun Jiang, Xinyi Xie, Rui Dai, Jun Lu <br/>
									<b> Affected Product: </b> Tesla Mode 3 <br/>
									<b> Version: </b> Tesla Model 3: V11, Tesla Mobile App: V4.23 (test on Motorola Edge S Android 11) <br/>
		
									<b> CVE: </b> CVE-2022-37709 <br/>
								</p>

								<p>
									The Tesla app has a feature called Phone Key that turns a smartphone into a key. Locking and unlocking even starting Model 3 with your phone key is conveniently hands-free.  
									As you approach, your phone's Bluetooth signal is detected and doors unlock. Further, you can start and drive the car without ever taking the phone out of a pocket.</br>
									However, this passive entry and start feature are not secure enough. Authentication can be bypassed by spoofing. 
									It allows attackers to open a door and drive the car away by leveraging access to a legitimate Phone Key.
								</p>

								<!--<blockquote><b>NOTE:</b> All analysis below is legal allowed by the vehicle owner. And we have reported the vulnerability to Tesla and are waiting for the responses.</blockquote>-->

								<h3>How does it work?</h3>
								<p>The phone key communicates with Model 3 using Bluetooth in plain. The Bluetooth Phone Key reconnects to the Model 3 depending on
									 the vehicle's MAC address only. Since the MAC address of the car is static, an adversary can fake the Model 3 easily. The Phone
									 Key will reconnect to the device with the specific MAC automatically. 
									 In this case, the adversary forwards the messages to both sides as an intermediary. </br>
									Model 3 authenticates the key by two attestations. The Phone generates the second attestation based on a token 
									from the vehicle. According to our experiments, the update of the token is not related to the connection status and happens over hours. 
									It allows the adversary to complete the attack with one attack device. The adversary needs to approach the owner and the Model 3 in 
									turn to forward messages. By spoofing the Phone key and the vehicle, the attack device can bypass the authentication. Finally, the Model
									 3 unlocks the door and can be started.</p>

								<h3>More Technical Description</h3>
									<p>Here is a more detailed explanation of the exploit:</br>
									   The Phone Key and Model 3 will generate a shared secret by <code>ECDH</code>. The shared key is used to authenticate attestations.
									   The attestations are calculated by <code>AES-GCM</code>.</p>
									
									<div class="col col-12-xsmall">
										<ol>
											<li>Get the MAC address <b>BD_ADDR</b> of the Model 3 according to advertisements broadcasting.</li>
											<li>Change the MAC address of the attack device same as Model 3 </li>
											<li>Approach the owner to get the first attestation <b>A</b>. 
											<li>Approach Model 3 to get the token <b>G</b> </li>
											<li>Approach the owner to get two attestations <b>A', B</b></li>
											<li>Back to the vehicle. The vehicle unlocks.</li>
										</ol>

									<h3>Impact and Demo</h23>
								</header>

								<blockquote>
									<ol>
										<li>The whole process is out of the awareness of the car owner. People can drive your car without your permission.</li>
										<li>Because the token G remains fixed for several hours, the attacker has plenty of time to complete the Man in the Middle Attack. The parking lot near Starbucks or supermarkets appears to be a great place to perform the attack.</li>
										<li>Since most of the communication data on the Bluetooth channel is in plaintext, it is easy for an attacker to replay some fixed data, such as request commands and vehicle status information.</li>
										<li>Any devices that support BLE 5 can exploit this vulnerability to complete the attack.</li>
									</ol>
								</blockquote>
								<p>
									Our results show that attackers can break into Tesla Model 3 and drive it away in one minute without the awareness 
									of the car owner. It brings into question the security of Passive Keyless Entry and Start (PKES) and Bluetooth 
									implementations in security-critical applications.<br>
									
								</p>
								<p>   
									We created an app named TesMla for Android device to conduct the attack.<br>
									You can check the demo vedio for attack on the <a href="https://youtu.be/cPhYW5FzA9A"><b>Youtube</b></a>. <br>
									More information for the app is on the <a href="https://github.com/fmsh-seclab/TesMla"><b>Github</b></a>. <br>

								<h3>Possible countermeasures</h3>
								<ul class="feature-icons">
									<li class="icon solid fa-bolt">
										<h5>Turn on PIN 2 Drive</h5>
										<p> Car owners can enable this multi-factor authentication countermeasure. It allows owners to program a personal
											identification number. This feature forces the owner to enter these numbers into the screen to drive the car.  
										 </p>
									</li>
									<li class="icon solid fa-book">
										<h5>BLE encryption</h5>
										<p> Tesla can enable secure BLE communication.
											The communication between end devices will be protected by this session key. Enabling BLE encryption will
											improve the difficulty of the analysis. </p>
									</li>
									<li class="icon solid fa-code">
										<h5>Refresh Token frequently</h5>
										<p> Tesla can update the token every time the Model 3 establishes a BLE connection. The adversary has to
											use two attack devices connecting to the Phone Key and Model 3 simultaneously. 
											To a certain degree, refreshing the token fast enough will reduce the attack window.</p>
									</li>
									<li class="icon solid fa-cubes">
										<h5>ToF-based secure ranging</h5>
										<p>The UWB utilizes the ToF technique to measure the distance. Messages of measurement or
											synchronization require encryption or signature by a trusted module,
											Secure Element (SE) for example.</p>
									</li>
